                <p class="articleTitle" id="question1">What is Creative Commons and what do you do?</p>
                <p class="articleText">Creative Commons is a global nonprofit organization that enables sharing and 
                    reuse of creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal tools. Our legal tools help 
                    those who want to encourage reuse of their works by offering them for use under generous, standardized 
                    terms; those who want to make creative uses of works; and those who want to benefit from this symbiosis. 
                    Our vision is to help others realize the full potential of the internet. CC has affiliates all over the 
                    world who help ensure our licenses work internationally and who raise awareness of our work.</p>
                <p class="articleText">Although Creative Commons is best known for its licenses, our work extends beyond 
                    just providing copyright licenses. CC offers other legal and technical tools that also facilitate sharing 
                    and discovery of creative works, such as CC0, a public domain dedication for rights holders who wish to 
                    put their work into the public domain before the expiration of copyright, and the Public Domain Mark, a tool 
                    for marking a work that is in the worldwide public domain. Creative Commons licenses and tools were designed 
                    specifically to work with the web, which makes content that is offered under their terms easy to search for, 
                    discover, and use.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p class="articleTitle" id="question2">Is Creative Commons against copyright?</p>
                <p class="articleText">Absolutely not. CC has responded to claims to the contrary. CC licenses are copyright 
                    licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators 
                    and other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights. 
                    Those who want to make their work available to the public for limited kinds of uses while preserving their 
                    copyright may want to consider using CC licenses. Others who want to reserve all of their rights under 
                    copyright law should not use CC licenses.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p class="articleTitle" id="question3">What does "Some Rights Reserved" mean?</p>
                <p class="articleText">Copyright grants to creators a bundle of exclusive rights over their creative works, 
                    which generally include, at a minimum, the right to reproduce, distribute, display, and make adaptations. 
                    The phrase "All Rights Reserved" is often used by owners to indicate that they reserve all of the rights 
                    granted to them under the law. When copyright expires, the work enters the public domain, and the rights 
                    holder can no longer stop others from engaging in those activities under copyright, with the exception 
                    of moral rights reserved to creators in some jurisdictions. Creative Commons licenses offer creators a 
                    spectrum of choices between retaining all rights and relinquishing all rights (public domain), an 
                    approach we call "Some Rights Reserved."</p>

            <article>
                <p class="articleTitle" id="question4">Can Creative Commons give legal advice about its licenses or other tools, or help with CC license enforcement?</p>
                <p class="articleText">No. Creative Commons is not a law firm and does not provide legal advice 
                    or legal services. CC is similar to a self-help service that offers free, form-based legal documents 
                    for others to use.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p class="articleTitle" id="question5">Does Creative Commons collect or track material licensed under a CC license?</p>
                <p class="articleText">No, CC does not collect content or track licensed material. However, CC builds technical 
                    tools that help the public search for and use works licensed under our licenses and other legal tools, 
                    and many others have built such tools as well. CC Search is one tool developed by CC to help the public 
                    discover works offered under Creative Commons licenses on the internet via CC-aware search engines and 
                    repositories.</p>

            <article>
                <p class="articleTitle" id="question6">What do the Creative Commons buttons do?</p>
                <p class="articleText">The CC buttons are a shorthand way to convey the basic permissions associated with 
                    material offered under CC licenses. Creators and owners who apply CC licenses to their material can 
                    download and apply those buttons to communicate to users the permissions granted in advance. When the 
                    material is offered online, the buttons should usually link out to the human-readable license deeds 
                    (which, in turn, link to the license itself).</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <p class="articleTitle" id="question7">May I use the Creative Commons logo and buttons?</p>
                <p class="articleText">You may download high resolution versions of the Creative Commons logos and use 
                    them in connection with your work or your website, provided you comply with our policies. Among other 
                    things, if you use the logos on a website or on your work, you may not alter the logos in any 
                    respect—such as by changing the font, the proportions, or the colors. CC's buttons, name, and corporate 
                    logo (the “CC” in a circle) are trademarks of Creative Commons. You cannot use them in ways not 
                    permitted by our policies unless you first receive express, written permission. This means, for example, 
                    that you cannot (without our permission) print your own buttons and t-shirts using CC logos, although 
                    you can purchase them in CC’s store.</p>

                <p class="articleTitle" id="question8">I love Creative Commons. How can I help?</p>
                <p class="articleText">Please support CC by making a donation through our support page. Donations can 
                    be handled through PayPal or by credit card. You can also support CC by visiting our store.</p>
                <p class="articleText">CC always welcomes your feedback, which you can provide by emailing 
                    info@creativecommons.org. You can also participate in CC's email discussion lists and share 
                    feedback and ideas in one of those forums.</p>
                <p class="articleText">If you are a software developer, sysadmin, or have other technical expertise, 
                    please join our developer community and help build the tools that build the commons.</p>
                <p class="articleText">Finally, one of the best ways to support CC is by supporting our causes 
                    yourself. Follow our blog to find out about current issues where you can help get involved and 
                    spread the word, and advocate for free and open licensing in your own communities.</p>
