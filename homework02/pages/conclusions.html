	<h2>IV. Conclusions</h2>
	<p>The major goal of this study was to determine which temporal features can predict <em>Task Cohesion</em> for individuals and teams who were engaged in global software development projects. The motivation for this work was the expectation that information about the cohesion levels among individuals and teams in global software development projects could lead to better interactions among team members, and ultimately better group performance. Although many researchers have explored relationships between certain collaboration variables <a href="references.html">[4], </a><a href="references.html">[5], </a><a href="references.html">[6], </a>few have examined the effects of temporal factors of pacing and synchrony. For example, previous research has indicated that certain linguistic similarity, information exchange, and message content can help determine cohesion levels within groups <a href="references.html">[7]</a>, <a href="references.html">[8]</a>, <a href="references.html">[9]</a>. However, we felt that just-in-time and abrupt communications  require new methodologies to measure
temporal phenomena that are more complex than simple
linear patterns. For example, current research has not captured
the effects of communication cycles spiraling up, down or
intensifying. Thus this work herein proposes a methodology
for describing the temporal narratives of distributed team
processes over time and determining whether they could be
used to predict Task cohesion. The three measures that were
developed for this study were Pacing similarity, Pacing rate,
and Synchrony. Each of these factors was examined at both
the individual and group level.</p>
	<p>Results showed a statistically significant negative correlation
between the Pacing rate and Task cohesion, which suggests
that frequent and perhaps sporadic rhythmic communications
about different social and work themes increases the cohesion
among team members. On the other hand, Pacing similarity
was not found to be related to Task cohesion, which suggests
that a minimum (although not equal) participation is necessary
for individuals to perceive that their group is cohesive. Thus,
Pacing similarity is not relevant to Task cohesion. We also
found a positive correlation between Synchrony and Task cohesion, which suggests the importance of establishing a rhythm
within a team. Finally, the temporal models constructed at
individual and group-levels were found to be good predictors
of Task cohesion, which indicates the existence of a strong
effect of frequent and rhythmic communications on cohesion
related to the task.</p>
	<p>Knowledge obtained from this study should provide insight into current empirical research on global virutal teams by defining the different temporal patterns that occur in these projects and how this can affect a team's perception of their cohesion levels.</p>
