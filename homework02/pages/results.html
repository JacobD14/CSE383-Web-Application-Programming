	<h3 id="sampleCharacteristics">A. Sample Characteristics</h3>
	<p>A total of 5583 messages were transmitted during the three
projects. A total of 167, out of a possible 180, Task cohesion
surveys were collected. Since we had 27 missing surveys, we
reduced the data set to include only those messages sent by
students who had completed the questionnaire; thus, we had
a total of 5446 messages in the final data set.</p>
	<h3 id="cultureEffect">B. The Culture Effect</h3>
	<p>We received cohesion surveys from people who were born
in eleven different countries. However, the majority of the
completed surveys came from students born in India, the US,
and Mexico (i.e n &gt; 20), while only a few surveys came
from students born in other countries (i.e. n &lt; 4). As a result,
we reduced the data set even further by using data from only
students born in India, the US, and Mexico; thus, ending up
with a final count of 4849 messages sent by 153 individuals.
We then compared the Task cohesion mean values between
countries and found that students from India tended to have
higher Task cohesion perceptions than either US or Mexican
students (see Table I). As a result, we used the Culture factor
as a control variable in our analyses.</p>

	<h3 id="pacing">C. Pacing at project-level</h3>
	<p>As indicated in Table II, in the colum labeled "Instances used," some of the participants were removed from this set of
data. Students who posted only one message were not included
in the data for this category because the pacing similarity
measure cannot be calculated in cases where there is only
a single instance. Thus, students who transmitted only one communication were eliminated from the computations for the
pacing variable.</p>
	<p>Data analyzed for the remaining subjects appears to indicate
that Pacing similarity has a similar value across all three
projects; however, a comparison of the Pacing rate shows that
the communication rhythms within the three projects were
dissimilar. More specifically, the rate of student replies was
much slower in the last project.</p>

	<h3 id="temporal">D. Temporal measures and Task cohesion</h3>
	<p>Using the final data set, we calculated the correlation
between Pacing similarity and Task Cohesion and between
Pacing rate and Task cohesion at the Individual-level</p>
	<p>Table III shows that Pacing similarity has no effect on
Task cohesion. On the other hand, Pacing rate has a weak,
but statistically significant effect on <em>Task Cohesion</em>. This
correlation, albeit weak, suggests that frequent communication
tends to lead to an increase in an individual's perception of
Task cohesion, possibly because the more that team members
discuss information about either social or work activities,
the more team members trust one another and have positive
feelings towards one another. The lack of a relation between
Pacing similarity and Task cohesion suggests that individuals
prefer frequent, although erratic, communication (Pacing rate)
with team members, over a more uniform, but less frequent,
rate of communication.</p>

	</table>
	<p>Moreover, the Pacing rate metric consists of 2 components:
1) Duration of communication (time between first and last
communications), and 2) Number of communications. As a
result, we analyzed the relation of these two components to
Task cohesion. Table IV shows that both components have a
statistically significant relation to Task cohesion. The relation
of the Number and Duration of communications to Task
cohesion may represent the communication engagement by each participant. Therefore, participants who are engaged in
the project will perceive a greater team cohesion than those
who are not.</p>

	<p>In addition to our pacing measures, we calculated the temporal variable of Synchrony for team members. The results of
this analysis, as presented in Table V, suggests that Synchrony
is a very good predictor of Task cohesion. Therefore, this
metric seems to capture the synchrony of collaborations among
team members, regardless of the frequency of when those
communications occur (e.g. communications every 12 hours,
versus communications every 24 hours, etc).</p>

	<p>A model using the Pacing rate (pr) and Synchrony (sy)
(while controlled by Team size (ts) and Culture (cu)) was
created to predict Task cohesion (coh). The top row in Table
VI shows that the temporal model is a good predictor of
the variability of the Task cohesion variable (r=0.358). Thus,
our model indicates that temporal-based measures at the
individual-level are helpful for understanding the perceptions
of Task cohesiveness.</p>
	<p>We also tested the prediction power of these measures at
the Group-level by using Team size (ts), Group pacing rate
(gpr), Group synchrony (gsy) and Group Task cohesion (gcoh).
Results shown in the last row of Table VI indicate that Grouplevel temporal measures are also good predictors of Task
cohesion.</p>
