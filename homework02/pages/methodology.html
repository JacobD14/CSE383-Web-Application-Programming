	<h3 id="teams">A. Teams</h3>
	<p>The data set that was used in this study was obtained
from three student global software development projects that
occurred between 2014 and 2015. Students who participated
in these projects were enrolled in computer science courses at
the University of North Texas and Universidad Politecnica de Altamira, which were located at the United States of America
and Mexico, respectively. While each of the three projects
contained some aspect related to the software development
process, the actual assignments often varied in terms of team
size (4-8 members), and specific task. For example, two of
the projects asked students to redesign a non-profit website.
The specific tasks consisted of redesigning three sections of
the website (i.e., the home page, the events page, and the
contribution page) and implementing a database that could
support the various operations that were needed to maintain
the three pages. A third project consisted of the creation
of a website that would allow students to learn about an
optimization algorithm. The various elements of the website
included a section where users could read information about
the algorithm, as well as a sections where users could test the
algorithm.</p>
	<h3 id="software">B. Software</h3>
	<p>Students who participated in the three projects were asked
to communicate with one another using a project management
web application. This application platform supported several
collaborative tools including chat, forums, wikis, document
sharing, etc. Moreover, the particular application software was
enhanced so that it recorded and timestamped all interactions
among group members and transferred this information to a
centralized database.</p>
	<h3 id="measures"> C. Measures</h3>
	<p>In order to analyze the group data, we developed three
temporal measures (Pacing similarity, Pacing rate, and Synchrony), which we believed to be good predictors of a team's
Task Cohesion levels within a global software development
context.</p>
	<p><ol>
		<li><em>Task cohesion: </em>Cohesiveness is a construct that measures the degree to which team members are working together. To calculate the value of this construct, we used an individual survey approach because it seemed more appropriate for a distributed virtual team context <a href="references.html">[1]</a>. Therefore, this research focused on the prediction of group cohesion through an individual survey intended to capture an individual's perception of their team, as defined by questions on the Task Cohesion section of the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ) <a href="references.html">[2]</a>. A group's cohesion measure was then obtained by averaging each team's individual responses to the survey. In this work, the cohesion values obtained from this survey were then aggregated and called Task cohesion.</li>
		<li><em>Pacing rate and Pacing similarity: </em>The Pacing rate (pr) was defined as the average number of seconds between messages from the same user. After this information was obtained, we computed the Pacing similarity score for each member by averaging the similarity of the Pacing rate of a user <em>i</em> to the Pacing rate of the rest of the team members, one at a time (see Equation 1). <img src="images/equation.png" alt="equation 1"></li>
		<li><em>Synchrony: </em> The other major temporal measure captures the synchrony of messages sent between two individuals; where the messages from each user are defined as a time series, and then these frequencies are then compared to one another, one at a time <a href="references.html">[3]</a>. For instance, Figure 1 shows, as a data series, the number of message sent by four participants in a team.<br>We estimated the spectral density from each data series by
creating a periodogram using a Fast Fourier transform. The
Figure 2 shows the periodogram, a diagram of frequencies by
amplitude.<br>
	From this information, we calculated the coherence between
two time series, which was the correlation between paired
members of each frequency. As a result we got a coherence
series for each combination of pairs within a team (c(2, n)),
see Figure 3.<br>

	</figure>
	This calculation, then, results in a vector of coherence values
(each value representing coherence in a specific frequency)
between two subjects. To provide a unique temporal value
between two individuals, we took the highest coherence score.
Finally, for each participant in a team, we obtained the highest
coherence scores of a participant as compared to the rest of
the team members and averaged those scores. This measure
was called Synchrony<br>
	We also calculated these measures at the group-level by
averaging their values i.e. Group task cohesion, Group pacing
rate, Group synchrony.</li>
	</ol></p>
	<h3 id="linearModel">D. Linear Model</h3>
	<p>Using the previous metrics, we proposed a set of experiments that would produce an assessment of the performance
of temporal features as predictors of Task cohesion</p>
	<p>In this set of experiments, we examined the relationship
between Task cohesion and the three temporal measures of
Synchrony, Pacing similarity, and Pacing rate. We also chose
between Pacing similarity and Pacing rate as the best pacing
representation to create a linear model.</p>
